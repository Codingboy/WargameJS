# Contributing

I welcome contributions from anyone and everyone. If you want to make any major changes please open an issue first, but for small changes you can simply create a pull. 

Before you make an contribution, please read GitHub Terms of Service: (Everything works as you think it works, but just make sure that you have the right to contribute the code you want to hand over.)
